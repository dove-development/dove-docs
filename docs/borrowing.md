# Borrowing

## How can I borrow with the Dove protocol?

1. Navigate to the [Vault tab](https://dove.money/vault) on the Dove protocol website and connect your Solana wallet using the button in the top-right.
2. Use the plus and minus buttons in the collateral list to deposit any of the supported collateral assets into your Vault.
3. Click "Borrow DVD" on the top-right, and input the amount of DVD you would like to generate against your collateral.
4. Click "Confirm" to open your position.

## Is there a maximum amount I can borrow?
There is no maximum amount of DVD that can be borrowed on the protocol. However, to prevent DVD from being collateralized entirely using one asset, there are limits on how much of one collateral can be deposited into the protocol. This may lead some deposit transactions to fail.

## What is the Loan-to-Value Ratio?
The Loan-to-Value Ratio is the total value of borrowed DVD compared to the total value of the collateral you've deposited. For example, if you borrow 50 DVD against $100 in SOL, your Loan-to-Value Ratio is 50%.

If the value of your collateral drops too far, your Loan-to-Value Ratio may exceed the governance-set maximum. When that happens, your position will be liquidated in order to protect system solvency.

## How long can I leave a position open?
There is no minimum or maximum loan duration with the Dove protocol. You can keep your position open indefinitely, so long as your Loan-to-Value Ratio remains below the maximum.
