# Savings

## What is Savings?
The Savings module allows users to deposit DVD in order to earn the governance-set Savings APY on their deposits. Users can deposit or withdraw DVD at any time, and will earn interest immediately and continuously.

## How can I save with the Dove protocol?

2. If you don't have any DVD, use the buttons in the collateral list to convert your stablecoins to DVD on the open market.
3. Click "Deposit DVD" on the top-right, and input the amount of DVD you would like to earn interest on.
4. Click "Confirm" to open your Savings account.

## Is there a minimum deposit to earn interest?
There is no minimum deposit to Savings. Interest is earned on any amount of DVD deposited, whether it's 0.01 or 1,000.

## Does my deposit get locked?
No, Savings deposits are not locked. DVD can be deposited or withdrawn from Savings at any time. There is no lock-up period.
