The Dove protocol takes a different approach - its decentralized stablecoin, Dove USD (DVD), is backed by cryptocurrency collateral worth more than the total DVD supply. Users can mint DVD by depositing collateral into smart contracts called Vaults.</p> <p>The following is a technical explanation of the economic incentives that allow DVD, a decentralized stablecoin, to exist and maintain its target peg.

The collateral's value must be higher than the amount of DVD the user wants to generate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Generating DVD: The user can generate DVD based on their deposited collateral's value, up to a limit set by governance. For example, if the limit is 80% and the user deposited $1,000 worth of collateral, they could generate up to 800 DVD.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interest accumulation: The Vault accumulates interest based on the amount of DVD generated. The interest rate is set by governance. This interest compounds continuously, increasing the Vault's debt and providing revenue for the protocol.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repaying DVD: To withdraw their collateral, the user must repay the DVD they generated plus the accumulated interest. This burns the returned DVD. If the user wants to withdraw only part of their collateral, they can repay a portion of the generated DVD.</p> </li> <li> <p>Liquidation: If the collateral's value falls enough to push the Vault's collateral ratio below the required minimum, the Vault is considered undercollateralized.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To protect the system's solvency, undercollateralized Vaults are liquidated. The protocol sells the collateral to repay the DVD debt and a liquidation penalty.

At launch, DVD's target price was 1 USD. This target increases continuously at an interest rate set by the DAO, making DVD a yield-bearing stablecoin. For example, if you bought $1 of DVD and held it for one year where the average interest rate was 7%, the value of your holdings would increase from $1.00 to $1.07.</p> <p>DVD maintains its target price through a balanced system of economic incentives. These incentives work in two directions: upward pressure mechanisms ensure DVD doesn't fall below its target, while downward pressure mechanisms prevent it from rising too far above. The following sections detail how these mechanisms work together to maintain DVD's stability.</p>"},{"location":"how_it_works/#pushing-to-target-price-or-higher","title":"Pushing to target price or higher","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Inherent value from collateral redemption: DVD tokens have inherent value because they are required to retrieve deposited collateral from Vaults. This creates natural demand for DVD. For example, let's say a user deposits $1,000 worth of collateral into a Vault, and generates 800 DVD tokens against this collateral. To get their $1,000 of collateral back, they must return 800 DVD. This makes each DVD effectively worth $1.25 ($1,000 / 800) to the user. So, the need to repay DVD to access valuable collateral gives DVD inherent value, driving demand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vault interest rates: Vaults accrue interest on borrowed DVD at a rate set by governance. Higher rates increase the incentive to repay debt and avoid liquidation, driving DVD demand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Savings rates: Users can earn interest on DVD by locking it in Savings.

This keeps DVD near its target even during brief periods of volatility.</p> <p>To limit the protocol's exposure in case of a stablecoin losing its peg, governance sets a ceiling on the amount of DVD that can be minted using Stability Modules, typically no more than 0.5% to 1% of the circulating DVD supply.</p>"},{"location":"liquidation/","title":"Liquidation","text":""},{"location":"liquidation/#what-are-liquidations","title":"What are liquidations?","text":"<p>The Dove protocol operates using overcollateralized loans. Users are allowed to borrow (mint) DVD from the protocol by depositing collateral: cryptocurrency worth more, by a significant margin, than the amount deposited. If the market value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold, then the protocol is at risk of the value of the collateral falling below the value of the DVD minted, which would cause the stablecoin, DVD, to be insufficiently backed. To protect against this, the protocol liquidates the position, selling the collateral on the open market before it can drop too far in value.</p>"},{"location":"liquidation/#how-are-liquidations-implemented","title":"How are liquidations implemented?","text":"<p>Liquidations are implemented using Dutch auctions. A Dutch auction is a type of auction that does not require bids. Instead, the price starts high, and falls continuously with time. For example, if you were to hold a Dutch auction for a chair that lasted an hour, the price might start at $200, then go down to $150 after 15 minutes, then down to $100 after 30 minutes, then down to $50 after 45 minutes, and finally fall to $0 at the end of the hour. If you have several participants that all want the chair, they are all incentivized to buy it at the highest price that they are willing to pay, due to the fear of another participant snapping it up.</p> <p>In the Dove protocol, collateral auctions begin at 150% of the market price, then sweep all the way down to 15% of the market price, where they are declared failed. Liquidation bots have an incentive to buy the collateral and sell it on the open market at the highest price that is profitable, because otherwise another liquidation bot might get there first.</p>"},{"location":"liquidation/#is-there-a-fee-for-being-liquidated","title":"Is there a fee for being liquidated?","text":"<p>Yes, there is a fee for being liquidated. When a liquidation occurs, the outstanding debt of the Vault is increased by 5%. In situations of extreme market volatility, the liquidation process may not be swift enough to fully repay a Vault's outstanding debt before the value of the collateral diminishes significantly. This results in bad debt for the protocol. The 5% liquidation fee thus acts as an insurance fund, where successful liquidations provide revenue to the protocol to offset any losses from failed liquidations.</p>"},{"location":"liquidation/#how-can-i-run-a-liquidation-bot","title":"How can I run a liquidation bot?","text":"<p>To run a liquidation bot, you can refer to this GitHub repository for an example implementation.
